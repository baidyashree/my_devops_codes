0) change hostname and reboot, then "apt-get update -y" command

1) create fully qualified domainname
update /etc/hosts on puppet server as follows, 
root@puppet-server:~# cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       ubuntu

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
192.168.0.8 puppet-server.local puppet-server
192.168.0.10 puppet-client.local puppet-client
root@puppet-server:~#

Note: check with hostname -f commands
it should show like puppet-server.local


2) wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-pc1-xenial.deb
3) dpkg -i puppetlabs-release-pc1-xenial.deb
4) apt-get update
5) now you can see entries in /etc/apt/sources.list.d

root@puppet-server:~# cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/puppetlabs-pc1.list
# Puppetlabs PC1 xenial Repository
deb http://apt.puppetlabs.com xenial PC1

# Puppetlabs PC1 xenial Source Repository
# The source repos are commented out by default because we
# do not always make sources available for all packages or
# for all platforms. If you want to access the source repos,
# uncomment the following line.

7) Restart puppet server
systemctl stop puppetserver
systemctl start puppetserver


8) systemctl status puppetserver

update following,

Change the Java memory /etc/default/puppetserver 
from

JAVA_ARGS="-Xms2g -Xmx2g -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"

to

apt-get install puppet -y  ==> note just puppet, means client



Now let us connect puppet client and server
============================================
1) on clinet machine,
puppet agent -t agent -t --server=puppet-server.local

root@puppet-client:~# puppet agent -t agent -t --server=puppet-server.local

2) go to puppet-server
puppet cert list -all

root@puppet-server:~#

Note:
as + is missing infront of puppet-client.local, its not yet autorized.


3) on the serverside,
puppet cert sign puppet-client.local

root@puppet-server:~# puppet cert sign puppet-client.local

root@puppet-server:~#
 
 now + is there...

5) go to client machine,
puppet agent --enable
 
6)  puppet agent -t agent -t --server=puppet-server.local

root@puppet-client:~# puppet agent -t agent -t --server=puppet-server.local
